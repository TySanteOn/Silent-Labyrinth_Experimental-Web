## **Silent Labyrinth**

## Concept

This game is for 1-4 players.
You’ll be dropped inside a labyrinth, each of you in a different corner. Where you’ll have to find three keys to unlock the exit, but there is a catch.

You’ll be blind and the only way you can see is by using sound to echolocate your way through the labyrinth.

Also there’ll be a monster that wants to steal your keys. This monster can’t see, but will follow the sounds it hears, so you shouldn’t be too loud.

## Backstory 
\--- more info later \---

## Features
* Multiplayer
* Pulses aren’t continuous, there’s a waiting time between them.
* Choose between speaking or press space bar (this is a fallback for people who have loud roomies)
* Look around with WebVR (your phone & a google cardboard)

## Hints
The monster can’t see you, so when it walks past you you better shut up.
Don’t forget you can’t walk silently. 

## Controls:
* ⇧ walk forwards <br>

## **Silent Labyrinth**

## Concept

You’ll be dropped inside a labyrinth where you’ll have to find three keys to unlock the exit, but there is a catch...

You’ll be blind and the only way you can see is by using sound to echolocate your way through the labyrinth.

Also there’ll be a monster that wants to steal your keys. This monster can’t see, but will come to the sounds it hears, so you shouldn’t be too loud.

## Features

## Hints
The monster can’t see you, so when it walks past you you better shut up.
Don’t forget you can’t walk silently.
